"""Persistent hypothesis-chain ledger for the dynamic planner.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
    A multi-component vulnerability is a claim of the shape "component A trusts
    B's output; B's validation is weak; still needed: reachability from the
    edge". No single campaign settles that claim, and the campaigns that do are
    frequently weeks apart. This module stores those planner-authored
    hypotheses as CHAINS of LINKS in the knowledge database (the
    `hypothesis_chains` table created by `database.init_db`), so a chain opened
    in one run is loaded, extended and eventually settled by later runs. Load
    is deliberately cross-run: `load_open_chains` reads open chains from ALL
    runs, because cross-session continuity is the point.

    Links are settled deterministically -- no LLM touches the verdict.
    `update_chain_from_campaign` compares a finished campaign's target paths
    and findings count against each link's named components and flips link
    status by fixed rules (documented on the function). The planner writes the
    hypothesis; the campaign record confirms or refutes it.

TRUST POSTURE
    Every string in a chain originated from an LLM and then sat in a database
    that earlier (possibly prompt-injected) runs could write. Chain content is
    therefore UNTRUSTED both on the way in and -- because the DB itself is a
    stored-payload vector -- on the way out: every string is length-capped and
    stripped of terminal control sequences at both boundaries, and nothing in
    a chain is ever interpreted as an instruction, a path to open, or a
    capability. Chains direct attention, exactly like recall in `core.memory`;
    they never widen tools, sandbox, or trust.

DEGRADATION (INV-6)
    Nothing here may raise into the scan loop. Every reader tolerates a
    missing file, missing table, or corrupt row by returning empty; every
    writer tolerates failure by doing nothing. A broken chain ledger costs the
    planner a hint; it must never cost the scan.
