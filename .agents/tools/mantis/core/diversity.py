"""Diversification metrics: does this audit look like it actually searched?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
There is no ground truth and there never will be. Mantis will be run on monorepos we
never see, by people who will not tell us when it missed something. We cannot measure
recall, so the honest alternative is to make the run describe its own shape and let a
human judge whether that shape is plausible.

The specific failure this is aimed at is the one that looks most like success: a run
that reports twenty findings which are really the same finding twenty times. Twenty
instances of "unvalidated input" in twenty files, all from one area, all the same
weakness class, is one observation with a large count -- and it is indistinguishable
from thorough work if you only read the total.

WHAT IT MEASURES
----------------
Four things, each a plain count or ratio over validated/structural fields:

  * SPREAD    -- how many distinct areas produced findings, against how many were
                 examined. Low spread with high counts means one area dominated.
  * VARIETY   -- how many distinct weakness classes. One CWE across everything is a
                 single observation repeated.
  * DEPTH     -- how many findings survived review rather than being dismissed. A high
                 dismissal rate means the run was generating noise.
  * SILENCE   -- how many examined areas produced nothing at all. Not a defect on its
                 own, but the number a reader needs to interpret everything else.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
It does not score the run, grade it, or gate anything on the result. There is no
threshold at which a run is declared bad, because no such threshold is knowable: a
repository with one real defect SHOULD produce one finding in one area, and a metric
that called that failure would be worse than no metric. It reports the shape and says
what the shape could mean, in both directions. The reader decides.

It also never modifies a finding. Nothing here can change severity, status, or whether
something is reported -- it is strictly an observation about the set as a whole.
