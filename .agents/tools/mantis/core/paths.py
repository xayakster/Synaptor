"""Authoritative path-boundary helpers for operator-supplied targets (INV-4).

The scan target is supplied by the operator but its *contents* — including any
symlinks it contains — are attacker controlled.

Two distinct classes of escape are closed here.

1. **Symlink dereferencing.** ``Path.resolve()`` silently dereferences every
   component, so a leaf-only ``is_symlink()`` check is not sufficient: a hostile
   checkout can ship ``repo/link`` -> ``../../..`` and have ``repo/link/sub``
   resolve to an arbitrary host directory while every leaf check passes. The
   invariant enforced is component-wise:

       No component of the target may be a symlink whose target lies outside
       the directory that lexically contains it.

   This refuses every attacker-plantable escape while tolerating the benign
   platform indirections that make absolute paths usable at all, such as macOS
   ``/var`` -> ``/private/var``, which stay within their containing directory.

2. **Normalization-order differentials.** Any check that inspects a *lexically
   normalized* path while the caller consumes a *symlink-resolved* path is
   bypassable, because ``normpath`` collapses ``link/..`` textually (erasing the
   component that was going to be checked) whereas ``realpath`` dereferences
   ``link`` first and then applies ``..`` to its target. ``repo/vendor/../.ssh``
   validated clean and resolved to ``~/.ssh`` under exactly this differential.
   Rather than try to keep two normalizers in agreement, ``..`` is refused
   outright and no lexical normalization is performed anywhere in this module.
