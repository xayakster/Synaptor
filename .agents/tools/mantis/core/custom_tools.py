"""Tools a deployment declares for itself, and the limits they run under.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The 24 built-in tools are a closed set, and a workflow naming anything else fails
validation outright. So a site with an internal taint engine, a house SAST tool or a
proprietary fuzzer has exactly one option: fork. A fork never receives the next
security fix -- the same argument that stops `LocalCheckout` from reimplementing CP-1's
directory walk. Leaving the set closed does not prevent custom tools; it just makes the
unsafe way the only way.

WHAT MAKES THE BUILT-IN 24 SAFE, SO THIS CAN BE HONEST ABOUT NOT INHERITING IT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not confinement. Most of them run on the host with the host's full privilege --
`read_file` could open `~/.ssh/id_rsa`; nothing in the process prevents it. They are
safe because they ARE the enforcement: `read_file` is the containment for reads,
`run_sandbox` is the containment for execution, `_run_safe_git_command` is the git jail.
A chokepoint is only a chokepoint while no path goes around it, and an unreviewed
function added to that dict IS a path around it.

A declared tool therefore inherits none of that trust, and the two lanes below are the
two ways to grant capability without granting it.

THE THREAT THAT HAS NO ANALOGUE IN EVIDENCE SOURCES
---------------------------------------------------
An evidence source is called once, by us, before analysis, with arguments we chose. A
tool is called repeatedly, BY THE MODEL, with arguments the model composed after reading
the target's source code. `acme_taint(query=<something the repository suggested>)` is
the shape of every injection-to-execution chain. So argument handling, not just
registration, is where the safety has to live.

THE TWO LANES
-------------
  LANE A (declarative) -- the integrator ships a SPECIFICATION, never code. We execute
      it with an audited primitive: a parameterised query against the knowledge base, a
      read through CP-3. No third-party code runs in this process, so no new path
      around CP-1/2/3/4 is created. This covers the most common real request ("let me
      ask my own findings database something") at close to zero risk.

  LANE B (executable) -- the integrator's own binary. It never becomes a Python entry
      point in our process. It is a command dispatched through `ctx.sandbox.execute()`,
      the same path `run_sandbox` already uses, and it may only run when the effective
      sandbox meets a declared floor (gvisor or stronger). `static-only` is not a weak
      sandbox, it is the NO-OP environment: running a third-party binary under it means
      running it on the host, in the process holding the LLM credentials. It is also the
      default, which is why the floor fails closed rather than warning.

WHAT A DECLARED TOOL CAN NEVER DO
---------------------------------
  * Set a verdict field. `may_set_verdict` remains the single audit point (INV-1/INV-2).
  * Widen the sandbox, the operator ceiling, or any trust tier. A floor is a condition
    for running, never a request for more capability.
  * Shadow a built-in. Rebinding `read_file` would redirect the audited chokepoint to
    unreviewed code, so a name collision is refused rather than resolved.
  * Reach the network. Lane A never executes; Lane B inherits the guest's networkless
    configuration.
