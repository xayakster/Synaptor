"""Writes the run's findings as SARIF 2.1.0.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Until now the only way out of Mantis was the SQLite knowledge base. That is fine
for Mantis talking to itself and useless for everything else: a deployment that
wants findings in GitHub code scanning, an internal dashboard, or a ticket queue
has to read our schema and write a converter. SARIF is the standard interchange
format for exactly this, so the converter should be ours and written once.

This is EMISSION, which is the opposite trade-off from ingestion.
`mantis-pipeline-adapter` argues against SARIF for reading other tools' output,
and it is right: every scanner emits a different subset, so the parser absorbs
all of that variance. Emitting inverts it. We control what we produce and the
consumer needs no custom parser.

THE PATH PROBLEM, WHICH IS BOTH A LEAK AND A BUG
------------------------------------------------
`canonical_filepath` falls back to returning an ABSOLUTE path when it cannot
relativize one. That is reasonable for a local SQLite row and wrong here: a
SARIF file is meant to be uploaded, and `/Users/someone/work/secret-project/...`
discloses the host layout and the project name to whoever reads it.

It is also, independently, the single most common cause of SARIF that appears to
work: GitHub accepts a file with absolute URIs and then displays nothing,
because it cannot match the path against the repository tree. There is no error.

So this module RE-DERIVES every path from the scan root instead of trusting the
stored value, and a finding whose path cannot be made relative is dropped with a
counted, reported reason -- never emitted absolute, never dropped silently.

WHAT SARIF CANNOT SAY, AND WHY THAT MATTERS HERE
------------------------------------------------
SARIF has no field for "this finding is unverified". Every entry is a `result`
with a `level`. A finding nobody reproduced and a finding with a working
proof-of-concept are the same shape.

Mantis spends its entire design keeping that distinction (INV-1, the evidence
tiers, the reproduction gate). Flattening it on the way out would undo that at
the last step, so the verification state is written into `message.text` -- where
a human sees it without knowing our internals -- as well as into the property
bag for machines.
